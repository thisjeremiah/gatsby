title: 'Gatsby Starters'
---

The Gatsby CLI tool lets you install "starters". These are partially built sites
preconfigured to help you get moving faster on creating a certain type of site.

When creating a new site, you can optionally specify a starter to base your new
site on e.g.

`gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY] [URL_OF_STARTER_GITHUB_REPO]`

For example, to quickly create a blog using Gatsby, you could install the Gatsby
Starter Blog by running:

`gatsby new blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog`

This downloads the files and initializes the site by running `npm install`

If you don't specify a custom starter, your site will be created from the
[default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

There are several starters that have been created. Create a PR to include yours!
